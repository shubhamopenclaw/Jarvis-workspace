# Screen Printing Supply Research (Canada/Toronto Focus)
**Goal:** Deep Dive for Best Value Equipment & Plastisol Inks (Quarts).
**Location Strategy:** Prioritize **Toronto/GTA pickup** to kill shipping costs (Inks are heavy).

## 🏆 The "Golden" Supplier: Screentec (Mississauga)
**Why:** They are the industry standard in the GTA. You can drive there and pick up, saving ~$50+ in shipping.
*   **Location:** 1600 Mattawa Ave, Mississauga.
*   **Website:** `screentec.ca`

### 1. The Ink List (Plastisol - 1 Quart Each)
*Recommended Brand: **Wilflex Epic** or **International Coatings (ICC)** - Industry standards carried locally.*

| Item | Product Recommendation | Est. Price (CAD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Black** | **Wilflex Epic Amazing Bright White** (Wait, for Black use **Epic Matte Black** or **ICC 700 Series Black**) | ~$35.00 - $45.00 | Get a "Matte" black if possible for that premium look. |
| **White** | **Wilflex Epic Top Score White** or **Sprint White** | ~$40.00 - $55.00 | White is always more expensive. Do not cheap out here; cheap white is a nightmare to print. |
| **Red** | **Wilflex Epic National Red** (or similar "Brite Red") | ~$45.00 - $55.00 | Red pigments are costly. |
| **Clear** | **Wilflex Curable Reducer** (Viscosity Buster) | ~$35.00 - $45.00 | **CRITICAL:** This is what makes your ink soft. Mix 5-10% into everything. |

**Total Ink Cost:** ~$160 - $200 CAD + HST.

### 2. The Hardware (Best Value)
*   **Screens:**
    *   **20" x 24" Aluminum Frame (110 Mesh):** ~$35.00 CAD
    *   **20" x 24" Aluminum Frame (160 Mesh):** ~$35.00 CAD
    *   *Advice:* Buy 2 of each. 110 for White, 160 for Black/Red detail.
*   **Squeegee:**
    *   **12" - 14" Wood Handle (70 Durometer):** ~$25.00 - $30.00 CAD.
    *   *Why:* 70 Durometer is the "All Purpose" hardness. Wood is cheaper than aluminum.
*   **Scoop Coater:**
    *   **15" or 16" Dual Edge Coater:** ~$40.00 - $50.00 CAD.
    *   *Note:* You need one slightly smaller than the screen ID. For a 20x24 screen, a 15-16" coater is perfect.

## 🥈 The Online Challenger: Green Galaxy (Ryonet Canada)
**Why:** If you want the specific **FN-INK** brand (budget-friendly premium).
*   **Website:** `greengalaxy.ca`
*   **Shipping:** You will pay for it, but FN-INK is cheaper per quart.

| Item | FN-INK Equivalent | Est. Price (CAD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Black** | FN-INK™ Black | ~$30.00 |
| **White** | FN-INK™ White | ~$32.00 |
| **Red** | FN-INK™ Bright Red | ~$35.00 |
| **Clear** | FN-INK™ Curable Reducer | ~$30.00 |

*   **Verdict:** Ink is cheaper (~$127 total), but shipping might kill the difference vs. picking up at Screentec.

## 💡 The "Clear" Ink Clarification
You asked for "Clear". In screen printing, this usually means **Curable Reducer**.
*   **Reducer:** Thins the ink, makes the print feel softer (less "bulletproof vest" feeling). **BUY THIS.**
*   **Extender Base:** Makes ink more transparent (for vintage look).
*   **Gel Clear:** For glossy 3D effects. (Likely not what you want for Institutional vibe).

**My Advice:** Go to **Screentec**. Being able to ask "Hey, which White is curing best right now?" face-to-face is worth the extra $20. Plus, no shipping damage.
