# Toronto Blank Apparel Analysis for ALPHANIX

## Executive Summary: India vs. Local Sourcing
While your India pricing (~$4.00 CAD) is unbeatable on raw cost, the **Landed Cost** (including $2,000 in shipping/customs/duty) brings your real unit cost to **$9.35 - $11.85 CAD**. 

Sourcing from Toronto-accessible distributors eliminates the $1,950 factory shipping, the 18% duty, and the customs handling fees. This allows you to pay more for a "Premium" blank locally and still hit a similar or better Total Cost per Unit.

## 2. Competitive Deep-Dive

### A. The Gildan Hammer (H000) - "The Value King"
*   **Verdict:** It is significantly better than the standard Gildan 2000 (Ultra Cotton). Since it is **Combed Ring Spun**, it will feel very similar to your India samples.
*   **Pros:** Indestructible, consistent, available for pick-up in GTA to save shipping.
*   **Cons:** Not a true "Oversized" fit. You would need to size up for the ALPHANIX vibe.

### B. Shaka Wear (Max Heavyweight) - "The Streetwear Standard"
*   **Verdict:** This is what most premium "oversized" gym brands use before they custom manufacture.
*   **Pros:** 254 GSM (Heavier than your current 200-240 samples). It has the thick collar and structured drape you see in high-end bodybuilding brands.
*   **Cons:** Higher unit cost, but lower "overhead" compared to importing.

### C. House of Blanks (Scarborough, ON) - "The Luxury Option"
*   **Verdict:** Manufactured right in Scarborough (Roopa Knitting Mills). This is what brands like Supreme and Drake’s OVO have used for blanks.
*   **Pros:** Made in Canada (Major marketing point for ALPHANIX). 275 GSM is massive quality. 
*   **Cons:** Most expensive. It would squeeze your margins if sold at $38 CAD.

## 4. Recommendations for Shubham

1.  **Immediate Action:** Order 3 samples of the **Gildan Hammer (H000)** from `T-shirt.ca`. Compare the hand-feel to your India sample. If the quality is 90% there, the $2.00 profit increase and zero-import-headache is a massive win for a startup.
2.  **Strategic Move:** Look at **House of Blanks** specifically for a "Limited Edition / Made in Canada" drop. Their Scarborough factory is close to you; you can likely arrange a visit to see the fabric quality in person.
3.  **The Fit Gap:** Since your India order is already "Oversized" pattern, the Gildan Hammer (Classic Fit) will feel different. You must check if a Gildan Hammer XL fits the same as your India Large Oversize.
