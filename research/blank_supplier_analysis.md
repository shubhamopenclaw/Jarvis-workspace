## 🏢 Top Toronto/Canada Suppliers & Options

### 1. House of Blanks (Mississauga/Toronto)
*   **Vibe:** The absolute "God Tier" of Canadian blanks. They manufacture for Supreme and Noah.
*   **Product:** Heavyweight, structured, premium.
*   **Pros:** Unmatched quality, true "Luxury Streetwear" feel, Made in Canada (huge marketing plus).
*   **Cons:** **Price.**
*   **Estimated Cost:** ~$12.00 - $18.00+ CAD per unit (wholesale account required for exact pricing).
*   **Verdict:** Too expensive for your current $34-$42 MRP model. You would need to sell tees at $60+ to make this viable.

### 2. T-Shirt.ca / BlankApparel.ca / Northern Blanks (Distributors)
These are the main hubs for brands like Gildan, M&O, and American Apparel.

#### **Option A: Gildan Hammer (H000)**
*   **Specs:** 6 oz/yd² (approx 203 GSM), 100% Combed Ring Spun Cotton.
*   **Fit:** Classic/Relaxed (Not truly "Oversized" by modern standards, just boxy).
*   **Quality:** High. Much smoother than the rough Gildan Ultra Cotton (G2000).
*   **Price:** ~$4.50 - $6.50 CAD (varies by volume).
*   **Availability:** High (Toronto warehouses).
*   **Comparison:**
    *   **vs India 200 GSM:** Similar weight, but H000 is a "standard" fit, not a drop-shoulder "oversized" streetwear cut. You would need to size up to get the look, which messes with neck sizing.
    *   **Value:** beats your India landed cost ($5 vs $8-$9), **BUT** you lose the specific "streetwear cut" you likely have from India.

#### **Option B: Alstyle 1301 (Now American Apparel 1301)**
*   **Specs:** 6 oz (203 GSM), 100% Cotton (Open-end, rougher texture).
*   **Fit:** The OG streetwear boxy tee. Tight high neck, boxy sleeves.
*   **Vibe:** "Rugged," dry hand feel (like vintage band tees).
*   **Price:** ~$5.00 - $6.50 CAD.
*   **Verdict:** A classic, but "Open End" cotton feels cheaper/rougher than the "Bio-Wash/Silicon" finish you are getting from India.

#### **Option C: Shaka Wear (Via various distributors)**
*   **Specs:** 7.5 oz (Max Heavyweight).
*   **Vibe:** The LA oversized look. Thick, structured.
*   **Price:** ~$10.00 - $13.00 CAD.
*   **Verdict:** Competes with your 240 GSM option but likely more expensive landed.

## 💡 Strategic Findings & Recommendation

### The "Oversized" Trap
The main issue with Canadian distributors (Gildan, etc.) is the **Cut**.
*   **Gildan H000** is a *standard* t-shirt. It is not "Oversized" in the fashion sense (drop shoulder, wider chest, shorter body).
*   **Your India Supplier** is likely cutting these specifically as "Drop Shoulder Oversized."
*   **The Difference:** If you buy H000 here, you are selling a regular t-shirt. If you stick with India, you are selling a "Fashion Fit."

### The "Quality" Reality
*   **Your India Specs:** Ring Spun + Bio Wash + Silicon Wash is a **Premium Finish**.
*   **Local Cheap Options:** Gildan H000 is Ring Spun but lacks the silicon wash (less silky). Alstyle is carded open-end (rough).

### 🚀 Final Verdict
1.  **Stick with India for the 240 GSM / Oversized stock.**
    *   You cannot find a true *Drop Shoulder* 240 GSM blank in Canada for under $10 CAD easily. Your landed cost of ~$9.35 is excellent for that specific fashion cut.
2.  **Consider Testing Gildan Hammer (H000) for "Regular Fit".**
    *   If your "Regular Fit" 200 GSM from India is just a standard tee, you *could* save ~$2-$3 per shirt by buying H000 locally (~$5.50 CAD vs $8.02 Landed).
    *   **Action:** Buy **one** sample H000 from a local shop (or T-shirt.ca sample order) to compare the hand-feel. If it matches your India quality, switch the "Regular" line to local to save on shipping weight and duties.

### Summary Table

| Option | Weight | Fit | Est. Cost (CAD) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **India Import (Current)** | 200-240 GSM | **Fashion / Drop Shoulder** | **$9.35 (Landed)** | **Best Value for Design.** Hard to beat this specific cut/finish price. |
| **Gildan Hammer H000** | ~203 GSM | Standard Boxy | ~$5.50 | Good alternative for *Regular* fits only. Not oversized. |
| **Alstyle 1301** | ~203 GSM | Retro Boxy | ~$6.00 | Rougher texture. Good for "vintage" feel, bad for "luxury" feel. |
| **House of Blanks** | 250+ GSM | Premium Streetwear | $15.00+ | Too expensive for your current price point. |
