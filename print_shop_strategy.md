# Lean Print Shop Master Plan: ALPHANIX Production

This document outlines the most cost-effective strategy for setting up a startup screen printing operation focused on Plastisol inks for an initial run of 540 shirts.

## 1. Research & Strategy: The "Lean Startup" Setup
To minimize initial capital expenditure (CapEx) while maintaining professional quality, we prioritize "essential-only" high-quality consumables and DIY/budget-grade hardware where precision is less critical.

*   **Ink Focus:** Plastisol is the preferred choice for startups due to its long shelf life, ease of use (doesn't dry in the screen), and vibrant opacity on dark garments.
*   **Space Management:** Darkroom setup is required for emulsion coating and screen storage. A simple closet or light-tight box suffices.

## 2. Specifics: Budget Hardware & Screens
*   **Scoop Coater:** 14" or 15" Aluminum Dual-Edge Scoop Coater (~$15-$20). Essential for even emulsion application. Avoid using a squeegee for coating; it leads to uneven prints and pinholes.
*   **Screens:** Aluminum frames are superior to wood as they don't warp when wet. 
    *   **Mesh Count 110:** For heavy white ink and blocky designs (under-basing).
    *   **Mesh Count 160:** Best all-rounder for black ink and standard detail.
    *   **Buy List:** 2x 110 Mesh, 2x 160 Mesh (Pre-stretched 20"x24" Aluminum frames).
*   **Budget Emulsion:** **Baselayr Plastisol Emulsion** or **Ecotex PWR**. These are pre-sensitized (no mixing diazo), have a long shelf life, and are formulated specifically for plastisol inks.

## 3. Consumables: Minimum Requirements for 540 Shirts
For 540 shirts (assuming a standard 10"x12" design), the following quantities are needed:

*   **Black Ink:** 1 Quart (~$25). Yield: ~150-200 shirts per quart depending on mesh. 540 shirts will require **3 Quarts** (or 1 Gallon for better value).
*   **White Ink:** 1 Gallon (~$60). White ink is thicker and requires more volume. Yield: ~60-80 shirts per quart on 110 mesh. 540 shirts will require approx **2 Gallons** (assuming some under-basing or heavy hits).
*   **Clear / Curable Reducer:** 1 Pint (~$15). Used to thin ink for easier printing without losing opacity.
*   **Emulsion:** 1 Quart (~$30). Yield: ~30-40 screens. More than enough for this run.

## 4. Process: The DIY Workflow
*   **Burning Screens (No Transparency Printer):**
    *   **The DIY Oil Hack:** Print your design on standard 20lb bond paper using a regular laser printer. Rub the back of the paper with **Baby Oil** or **Mineral Oil** until it becomes translucent. Blot off excess oil. This allows UV light to pass through the "clear" paper while the black toner blocks it.
    *   **Local Print Shop:** Most FedEx/Kinkos or local shops can print 11"x17" transparencies for ~$2.00/sheet. This is more reliable for fine detail than the oil hack.
*   **Screen Longevity:** With proper care (using plastisol press wash, not water, to clean ink), a screen can last for thousands of impressions. 
*   **Reclaiming:** Use **Emulsion Remover** and a pressure washer. For 540 shirts, you likely won't need to reclaim during the run unless you make a mistake.

## 5. Economics: Estimated Cost Per Shirt
*Note: Excludes shirt cost and labor.*

| Item | Qty | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Aluminum Screens (4-pack) | 1 | $85 |
| Scoop Coater | 1 | $18 |
| Plastisol Ink (White - 2 Gal) | 2 | $120 |
| Plastisol Ink (Black - 1 Gal) | 1 | $55 |
| Emulsion (1 Qt) | 1 | $30 |
| Chemical Kit (Degreaser, Remover, Wash) | 1 | $45 |
| DIY Exposure (50W UV LED Flood) | 1 | $25 |
| **Total Startup Consumables/Tools** | | **$378** |

**Calculation:** $378 / 540 shirts = **$0.70 per shirt**.
*Incremental cost for future runs (Ink/Emulsion only) drops to approx **$0.35 per shirt**.*

## 6. Key Buy List & Immediate Actions
1.  **Purchase:** 20"x24" Aluminum Screens (110 & 160 mesh).
2.  **Purchase:** Baselayr Plastisol Emulsion.
3.  **Purchase:** Gallon of "Wilflex" or "Union" White and Black Plastisol.
4.  **Setup:** DIY Exposure unit using a 50W UV LED light mounted 15" above the screen.
5.  **Test:** Perform a "Step Wedge Test" with the baby oil hack to find the perfect exposure time.
