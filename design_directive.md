# ALPHANIX Design Directive (Rev. Feb 26, 2026)
# Reference for Automated Design Generation

## 🎨 Aesthetic: "Institutional Athleticism"
**The Vibe:** A hybrid of **Gymshark's sleekness** and **Essentials' silhouette**, with **YoungLA's trend awareness**.
- **Keywords:** Premium, Disciplined, Typographic, Negative Space, "Quiet Luxury."
- **Color Palette:** Monochrome (Black, White, Grey, Denim Blue). High contrast.
- **Print Tech:** Single Color Plastisol. No gradients.
- **Rule #1:** Wearability First. If it looks like a souvenir or clip-art, kill it.

## 🚫 BANNED ELEMENTS (Strict)
- **NO LITERALISM:** No "CN Tower + Barbell" combos. No cartoonish fitness icons.
- **NO FORCED GEOGRAPHY:** Toronto/Canada references are *texture*, not the subject.
- **NO RIGID LAYOUTS:** The "4-pointer" cross/line structure is deprecated.
- **NO SOUVENIRS:** If it looks like it belongs in a gift shop, trash it.

## 📏 Constraints (The "Canvas")
- **Screen Size:** 20" x 24"
- **Max Print Area:** ~14" x 18".
- **Placement:**
  - **Standard:** Center Chest (Clean, spaced).
  - **Trend:** High Neck (Mock-neck style placement).
  - **Statement:** Vertical Spine (Technical data look).
  - **Detail:** Bottom Hem or Sleeve.

## 🧬 Design Pillars

### 1. Typography & Composition
*Text is architecture. Use negative space.*
- **Primary:** Montserrat (Clean, Institutional).
- **Secondary:** Bebas Neue (Bold, Impact).
- **Style:** Staggered grids, erased text, widely spaced kerning.
- **Goal:** Free-flowing. Don't confine text to boxes or lines unless intentional.

### 2. Imagery & Themes
- **Abstract Geometry:** Sharp angles, wireframes, "eroded" textures.
- **Institutional:** "ALPHANIX ATHLETIC CLUB" / "PHYS. ED." / "DIVISION 01".
- **Coordinates:** Subtle use only (e.g., small text block), not the main focus.

### 3. Collection Mix (Target: 5-Piece Drop)
**Ratio:** Focus on "The Essential" (Wearable) over "The Monument" (Loud).

| Type | Vibe | Placement | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ESSENTIAL** | Minimal Branding | Center Chest | Clean sans-serif. High wearability. |
| **TECHNICAL** | Data/Specs | Vertical Spine | Coordinates, "Lot No.", fabric specs. |
| **DROP** | Oversized | Back (High) | Large abstract geo or bold typography. |
| **DETAIL** | Subtle | Left Chest / Hem | Small text block. Uniform style. |

## ⚙️ Prompting Strategy (STRICT)

**Output Requirements:**
For each design concept, output TWO distinct Gemini Prompts + a Technical Breakdown.

1.  **Technical Breakdown:**
    *   **Placement:** (e.g., Center Chest, Back Vertical)
    *   **Max Dimensions:** (e.g., 10" x 12")
    *   **Ink:** (e.g., White Plastisol, Puff Print)

2.  **Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
    *   **Goal:** Crisp, clean product verification on white.
    *   **Format:** `A high-resolution product shot of a black heavyweight t-shirt folded neatly on a white surface. The graphic [Design Description] is printed in thick white plastisol ink. 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting, sharp focus.`

3.  **Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
    *   **Goal:** Gritty, real-world context.
    *   **Format:** `A cinematic shot of a black t-shirt hanging on a rusted metal locker in a cold, dim gym locker room. Toronto morning light filtering through a high window. The graphic [Design Description] is visible. 35mm film grain, moody, desaturated, street photography style.`
