# ALPHANIX Design Engine - Status

The nightly design job (cron) is currently configured to be **Text-Only**.

## Why?
1. **Cost Control:** Generating high-quality images for *every* idea automatically burns tokens/credits fast.
2. **Curation:** It allows you to review the *concept* (the words/vibe) before committing resources to the *visual*.

## Current Output
It produced `designs/Design-001-260226-03-00.md` which contains:
- The **Creative Direction** (Vibe: "Concrete & Coordinates")
- The **Exact Prompts** needed to create the images (e.g., "Brutalist CN Tower x Barbell...").

## Next Step (Manual Trigger)
To see the actual images, I need your permission to run the generation tool using those prompts.

**Shall I generate the 2 images for "Concrete & Coordinates" now?**
