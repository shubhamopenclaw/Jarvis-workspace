# Project: ALPHANIX Women's Line (The "Lulu" Standard)
**Goal:** Match Lululemon "Align" quality (Buttery Soft, Squat-Proof).
**Status:** Deep Research findings.

## 🧬 The "Secret Sauce" (Fabric Analysis)
To compete with Lululemon, you cannot use standard Polyester/Spandex. You need **Nylon 6.6**.

### 1. The Composition (The "Align" Formula)
*   **Target Fabric:** "Nulu" Clone.
*   **Fiber Blend:** **80-81% Nylon 6.6 + 19-20% Lycra (Elastane).**
    *   *Why Nylon 6.6?* It’s softer, stronger, and cooler to the touch than standard Nylon 6 or Polyester.
    *   *Why Lycra?* You need branded Lycra (or high-grade Spandex) for 4-way stretch that doesn't bag out at the knees.
*   **Finish:** **Double Brushed (Peached)** on both sides. This is the non-negotiable step that creates the "buttery" feel.
*   **Weight (GSM):**
    *   *Lulu Aligns:* ~215-220 GSM (Very light, "naked" sensation).
    *   *Your Target:* **240-260 GSM**.
    *   *Why?* 220 GSM is risky for "squat proof" opacity if the quality isn't perfect. 250 GSM gives you that premium hold while staying soft.

### 2. Construction Specs (The Details)
*   **Stitching:** **Flatlock Seams** (4-needle, 6-thread). Essential to prevent chafing.
*   **Crotch:** **Diamond Gusset**. Never use a simple cross-seam; it creates a "camel toe" effect and rips easily.
*   **Waistband:** Seamless/Bonded or "Self-Fabric" waistband (no elastic band inside that cuts into the skin).

## 🌍 Sourcing Strategy: India vs. China
Here is the hard truth about manufacturing high-end synthetics in India.

### The Challenge with India (Tirupur/Ludhiana)
*   **Strength:** India is the *Global King of Cotton*. Your oversized tees? India is perfect.
*   **Weakness:** India *lags* in high-end synthetic man-made fibers (MMF) like Nylon 6.6.
*   **The Reality:** Most "Premium Activewear" manufacturers in India **import the fabric from China or Taiwan**, then cut & sew in India.
    *   If you find a supplier in Tirupur who says "Yes, we have Nylon Spandex," ask: *"Is this domestic fabric or imported?"* Domestic Indian nylon often feels more "plasticky" (Nylon 6) than the buttery Nylon 6.6.

### Recommended Path for India Production
If you want to stick with India (to consolidate shipments/relationships), you must direct your supplier to **Source Imported Fabric**.

**Key Questions for your Supplier:**
1.  "Do you have access to **Nylon 6.6 Interlock with Brushed Finish**?"
2.  "Can you achieve a **Peach Skin / Sueded hand-feel**?"
3.  "Is this fabric mill-made in India or imported from China/Taiwan?" (Prefer imported for now).

### Potential Indian Suppliers (Verified for Activewear)
*   **Synerg (Tirupur):** Explicitly lists premium activewear/leggings. Good bet for "Cut & Sew" of imported fabrics.
*   **NG Apparels (Ludhiana):** Strong infrastructure for technical textiles.
*   **Activewear Productions (Tirupur):** Specializes in N66 vs N6 sourcing.

## 🚀 Execution Plan (The "Deep Mode" Verdict)

1.  **Do NOT use your T-Shirt guy** unless he explicitly proves he has a separate activewear division. T-shirt factories (Jersey knit) rarely have the Flatlock machines or fabric sources for Leggings (Interlock knit).
2.  **Request Samples First:** Ask for a "Nylon 6.6 Brushed Legging Sample."
3.  **The "Squat Test":** When you get it, stretch it over your knee (black fabric). If it sheers out and you see skin, reject it. You need 250 GSM.

**Summary:**
*   **Fabric:** 80% Nylon 6.6 / 20% Spandex (Brushed/Peached).
*   **Weight:** 250 GSM.
*   **Origin:** Fabric likely China -> Sewn in India.
