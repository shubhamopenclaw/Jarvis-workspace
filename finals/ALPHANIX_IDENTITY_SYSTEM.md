The t-shirt features a structured, institutional performance design. The main dominant wordmark reads 'ALPHANIX' in large bold typography. Underneath, include the subline '[SUBLINE]' in smaller technical font. Layout style: [LAYOUT_TYPE]. Design color: [CONTRAST] print on [COLOR] fabric. The atmosphere should feel high-performance, disciplined, engineered, and authoritative. Clean studio lighting. Premium athletic brand aesthetic. No streetwear vibe. No artistic effects. Focus on clarity, structure, and performance identity."
