## The Core Identity: "Institutional Athleticism"

### ✅ Keywords to Use (The "In" List)
- **Monolithic:** Single-piece power, solid, heavy, presence.
- **Institutional:** Established, permanent, authoritative, architectural.
- **Disciplined:** Precise, intentional, focused, "the work."
- **Sculptural:** Focusing on the drape, silhouette, and fabric weight.
- **Atmospheric:** Focus on lighting, mood, and environment (dawn, empty gym, locker rooms).
- **Minimalist:** High tracking, negative space, clean lines.

### ❌ Keywords to Avoid (The "Out" List)
- **Industrial / Rugged / Gritty:** Sounds too much like construction or workwear.
- **Streetwear:** Too generic. We are "Institutional Athletic."
- **Cluttered:** No excessive graphics or front-heavy designs.
- **Viral / Gimmicky:** We prioritize longevity over temporary trends.

## Visual Tone
- **Lighting:** High contrast, cinematic, shadows that define muscle/fabric texture.
- **Settings:** High-school tracks at dawn, cold locker rooms, structured minimalist training facilities.
- **Typography:** Montserrat (Institutional/Clean) and Bebas Neue (Disciplined/Bold).

## Narrative Style
- Direct, candid, and high-status. 
- We don't ask for attention; we command it through technical superiority and monolithic presence.
