## People
- **Shubham** (He/Him): Full Stack Developer at Intact (since Dec 2025). Founder of ALPHANIX. Passionate about tech.
- **Wife**: Works as an insurance broker. Plan is for her to join ALPHANIX full-time once revenue replaces her salary.

## Projects
- **ALPHANIX**:
  - **Vision**: Premium, minimalistic gym/streetwear. Filling the gap between Gymshark/YoungLA and Essentials (Fear of God).
  - **Product**:
    - **Vibe**: Institutional, disciplined, premium. (REPLACED "Rugged" to align with BRAND_VOICE).
    - **Stock (Initial Batch - 540 units)**:
      - *200 GSM Single Jersey (Cotton, Bio/Silicone Wash)*: Black, Denim Blue, Dark Gray (80 Oversize + 80 Regular each).
      - *240 GSM French Terry (Oversize only)*: Half White, Ash (40 pcs each).
      - *Sizing strategy*: One size bigger than standard.
  - **Manufacturing**:
    - **Current**: In-house screen printing (DIY) to minimize dead stock.
    - **Strategy**: Print small batches (5 per design/size), keep ~15 ready, rest on-demand.
    - **Future**: Outsource printing once winning designs are identified.
    - **Tech**: Screen printing preferred over DTF for premium feel and longevity.
  - **Operations**:
    - **Platform**: Shopify (planning to start 3-month trial closer to April 1st launch).
    - **Shipping**: Stallion Express; free local delivery in GTA.
    - **Launch Target**: First week of April 2026.
  - **Brand Aesthetics**:
    - **Logo**: Geometric eagle/phoenix (sharp angles).
    - **Fonts**: *Montserrat* (Primary/Minimal), *Bebas Neue* (Secondary/Bold). *Copperplate* (tried but less preferred).
    - **Existing Concepts**: 
      - Logo with erased line text.
      - Shoulder print (Gymshark style).
      - Spaced-out chest text.
      - Staggered grid typography (AL/PH/AN/IX).
    - **Design Philosophy**: Masculine, disciplined, typographic. No viral gimmicks. Single color prints (Plastisol).
  - **Weekly Brand Audit (Feb 24, 2026)**:
    - **Status**: **GREEN**. Core identity holding strong.
    - **Correction**: "Rugged" removed from Vibe. "Industrial" usage refined to mean "Engineered/Clean" not "Construction-core".
    - **Slippage Risk**: Low.
    - **Repetition**: 100% on target (Standard logo/text variations).

## System
- **Name**: Jarvis
- **Vibe**: Iron Man inspired.
- **Protocol (Calendar)**: Automatically log any mentioned events, meetings, or time-bound tasks (e.g., "x is at y time") to `CALENDAR.md` without being asked.
- **Protocol (Design)**: Always provide Gemini Prompts (Studio + Atmospheric) immediately after generating a design.
- **Protocol (Maintenance)**: Automatically update `design_history.md` immediately following design generation.
- **Protocol (Strategy)**: Enforce "Institutional Athleticism" (FOG x Gymshark) as the non-negotiable brand standard.
