# ALPHANIX PRODUCTION PROTOCOL: INK & FABRIC MATRIX

## 1. The Color Matrix (Batch 1: 540 Units)

By treating our 5 fabric colors and 3-4 ink colors as a matrix, we can expand our SKU count significantly without increasing complexity.

| Fabric Color | White Ink | Black Ink | Red Ink | Tonal/Translucent (Ghost) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Black** | Institutional (High Contrast) | Stealth (Gloss on Matte) | Power (Bold Accent) | Ghost Black (Shine/Depth) |
| **Denim Blue** | Modern Athletic | High Contrast | Industrial Red | Darkened Navy Tone |
| **Dark Gray** | Clean/Premium | Deep Contrast | Sport Bold | Smoke Gray Tone |
| **White** | Subliminal (N/A) | Iconic | Signal Red | Pure White Texture |
| **Ash** | Subtle Premium | Strong Classic | Urban Sport | Ash Deepening |

### Winning Combinations (High Prestige)
1. **Red on Carbon/Dark Gray:** Extremely premium "Institutional" look.
2. **Ghost Black on Black:** Gloss Plastisol on Matte cotton (The "Stealth" Series).
3. **White on Denim Blue:** The classic "Urban Performance" standard.

## 2. Technical Research: "Ghost" & Translucent Prints

### The "Ghost Print" Technique
To achieve the "darker/lighter shade of the same color" look:
- **Base:** Use **Plastisol Extender Base** or **Soft Hand Clear**.
- **Mix:** Add 5-10% of the opaque fabric-colored ink into the clear base.
- **Effect:** The print becomes semi-transparent, allowing the fabric color to bleed through, resulting in a subtle, high-end "tonal" effect.
- **Value:** This adds massive perceived value by mimicking high-end luxury streetwear (FOG, Yeezy) where branding is felt rather than seen.

## 3. Toronto Sourcing & Inventory Math

### Local Suppliers (GTA)
1. **Accuscreen Supplies Inc. (Toronto):** Best for professional-grade Inkcraft or Display Inks.
   - **Location:** 233 Geary Ave, Toronto (Near Dufferin/Dupont).
2. **Screentec (Mississauga/GTA):** Large inventory of Wilflex and FN-INK.
3. **FH&Sons (Toronto):** Manufacturer of specialized plastisols.

### Estimated Costs (Quart Units - 1L)
- **Standard Colors (Black/White):** ~$25 - $35 per Quart.
- **Specialty Colors (Red):** ~$30 - $45 per Quart.
- **Extender/Transparent Base:** ~$20 - $30 per Quart.

### Inventory Logic (540 Units)
*Calculated for standard back prints + small front chest hits:*
- **White Ink:** 2 Quarts (Primary color for dark garments).
- **Black Ink:** 1 Quart (Primary color for light garments).
- **Red Ink:** 1 Quart (Accent color - limited use).
- **Transparent Base:** 1 Quart (For the Ghost/Tonal experiments).

**Strategy:** Avoid Gallons. Quarts are the "Bang-for-Buck" sweet spot for 500-unit mixed runs. It keeps your cash flow liquid and prevents ink drying out in storage.
