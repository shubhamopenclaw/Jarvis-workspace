# 2026-02-23 Notes
- **System Audit**:
  - J.A.R.V.I.S. performed a "System Health & Character Audit".
  - **Identified Bloat**: Deleted duplicate `2026-02-22.md`.
  - **Identified Logic Drift**: "The Architect" (Concept 6) design is too complex for current "Lean Print Shop" production capabilities (baby oil transparency, halogen exposure).
  - **Corrective Action**: Enforced a "Minimum Line Weight" constraint for all designs until equipment upgrade.
  - **Strategic Shift**: Prioritizing bold, monolithic designs (e.g., "The Monument") over fine, micro-text details to maintain "Institutional Athleticism" quality perception.
