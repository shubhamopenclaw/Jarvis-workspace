# 2026-02-22 Notes

- **ALPHANIX Deep Dive**:
  - Shubham explained the "Why": Gap in the market for premium/minimalist gym wear (Gymshark/Essentials vibe).
  - Detailed inventory list recorded (540 units, specific GSMs and colors).
  - **Execution Strategy**:
    - "Do it yourself" mentality: Shubham will handle screen printing personally to ensure quality and save costs initially.
    - **Inventory**: Lean approach. Print small batches (5-15 units), print rest on order.
    - **Tech**: Shopify (waiting for April launch to maximize trial).
    - **Goal**: Scale until it replaces wife's income so she can join full-time.
  - **Brand Assets**:
    - **Logo**: Geometric eagle/phoenix design. Sharp, aggressive angles. Fits the "rugged/premium" aesthetic perfectly.
