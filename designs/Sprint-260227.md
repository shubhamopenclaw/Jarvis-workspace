# Design 009: The Schematic Eagle
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Theme:** Institutional Authority / Technical Precision

### Visual Description
A technical, blueprint-style breakdown of the ALPHANIX geometric eagle logo. The graphic features thin, precise white lines on a Dark Gray 200 GSM cotton tee. Small technical annotations (coordinates, "AL-X 1.0", "DRIVEN BY DISCIPLINE") are placed around the wings in a minimal Montserrat font, resembling an aerospace engineering drawing.

### Gemini Studio Prompt
> A high-resolution flat lay of a dark gray heavy-weight t-shirt. On the chest, a white technical schematic of a geometric eagle logo. The design consists of fine white vector lines, blueprint measurements, and technical typography. Sharp focus on the texture of the 200 GSM cotton. 8k, professional studio lighting, neutral background.

### Gemini Atmospheric Prompt
> A moody, low-light shot of a designer's desk. An ALPHANIX technical tee is draped over a drafting chair. In the background, a blurred computer monitor shows vector wireframes of the same eagle logo. Industrial aesthetic, cool tones, cinematic shadows.

# Design 010: Macro Negative Space
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Theme:** Minimalist Scale

### Visual Description
The word "ALPHANIX" in ultra-bold Bebas Neue, printed in matte black on a Black 200 GSM tee. The text is so large that it bleeds off the side seams, but the "negative space" between the letters forms the focus. A small, high-density 3D rubberized geometric eagle is placed precisely at the center of the 'X'.

### Gemini Studio Prompt
> Close-up shot of a black t-shirt featuring a large matte black 'ALPHANIX' typography print. The print uses high-density ink for a subtle 3D texture. A tiny, white rubberized eagle logo is centered on the bottom right of the 'X'. Macro lens, showing the fabric grain and the ink elevation.

### Gemini Atmospheric Prompt
> A model standing in a brutalist concrete hallway, back to the camera. The large-scale typography on the black shirt catches a single shard of harsh sunlight. High contrast, sharp shadows, urban architectural vibe.
