# ALPHANIX Design Concept 008
**Date:** 260226-23-00
**Theme:** "Industrial Containment" (Heavy Duty & Precision)

## Concept 1: LOUD ("The Heavy Bracket")
**Vibe:** Industrial, Cargo, Shipping Container.
**Placement:** Full Back (Center Scapula).
**Max Dimensions:** 12" x 8".
**Ink:** White Plastisol (Thick).

### Design Description
A design inspired by heavy machinery labeling.
*   **The Structure:** Two massive, thick square brackets `[ ]` enclose the text.
*   **The Text:** Inside the brackets, "ALPHANIX" is stacked in two lines:
    `[ ALPHA ]`
    `[  NIX  ]`
*   **The Font:** A monospaced, military-style stencil font (like Druk or a clean Stencil).
*   **The Detail:** The brackets are distressed slightly, like painted metal.
*   **Why it works:** It feels like the wearer is "cargo" or "heavy equipment." It frames the back width perfectly.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity (Male, age 30–35, thick dark brown hair, stubble, athletic build) wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The model stands confidently against a soft off-white seamless studio background. The graphic on the back is a massive industrial design: distinct heavy square brackets enclosing the stacked text "ALPHA / NIX". The font is a bold military stencil style. Printed in thick white matte plastisol. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus, clean editorial aesthetic.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a tree branch outdoors. The graphic is a large industrial "bracket" design with stenciled text ("[ ALPHA / NIX ]"). The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise, softly out of focus. Early morning warm natural light casts subtle highlights on the white ink. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic.

## Concept 2: QUIET ("The Ribcage Data")
**Vibe:** Hidden Tech, tactical.
**Placement:** Right Side Seam (Ribcage area).
**Max Dimensions:** 1" x 5" (Vertical).
**Ink:** Matte Grey (Subtle).

### Design Description
**NOT** on the chest, **NOT** on the back.
*   **Location:** Running vertically *up* the right side of the shirt, following the ribcage seam.
*   **Graphic:** A single vertical line of technical text: `OPS: TORONTO // DIV-06`.
*   **Orientation:** Rotated 90 degrees (reading bottom-to-top).
*   **Font:** Small, crisp sans-serif (Montserrat Medium).
*   **Why it works:** It’s completely invisible from the front or back. It only appears when the wearer lifts their arms (e.g., overhead press) or turns to the side. It’s a "discovery" detail.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity. The model is lifting his right arm slightly to reveal the side of the torso. Running vertically up the ribcage seam of the black t-shirt is a small line of technical text: "OPS: TORONTO // DIV-06". The print is subtle matte grey. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus on the ribcage detail.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging on a tree branch outdoors. The shirt is angled to show the side seam. A vertical line of technical text runs up the ribcage area. The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic.
