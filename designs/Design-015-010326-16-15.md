**Time:** 16:15 UTC

## LOUD Concept: "The Concrete Orbit"
**Theme:** Brutalist Structure / Circular Motion / Negative Space
**Vibe:** Industrial, raw, commanding. A structural ring that isn't a logo, but a stamp of heavy industry.

### Technical Breakdown
- **Placement:** Full Back (Centered).
- **Max Dimensions:** 12" x 12" (Circular).
- **Ink:** Heavy White Plastisol (Distressed Texture).
- **Font:** Stencil / Heavy Sans-Serif (Custom Distressed).

### Gemini Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)
A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The model stands confidently against a soft off-white seamless studio background with subtle gradient shadow. High-end commercial fitness lighting with soft overhead key light and controlled rim light outlining the shoulders and traps. The graphic is a large, circular typographical arrangement on the back. The words "ALPHANIX" and "TORONTO" form the upper and lower arcs of a circle in heavy, distressed white stencil font. The circle is implied by the text and interrupted brutalist line segments, with an empty center creating a negative space "portal". Printed in thick white colour using matte screen-print ink. Allow only natural fabric folds. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus, clean editorial campaign aesthetic, rugged luxury fitness brand.

### Gemini Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)
A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a tree branch outdoors. The graphic is a large, circular typographical arrangement on the back. The words "ALPHANIX" and "TORONTO" form the upper and lower arcs of a circle in heavy, distressed white stencil font. The circle is implied by the text and interrupted brutalist line segments, with an empty center creating a negative space "portal". Printed with a matte white plastisol screen-printing ink. The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise, softly out of focus with shallow depth of field (85mm lens look). Early morning warm natural light casts subtle highlights and realistic shadows on the fabric. Slight breeze movement creates natural cotton drape. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic, minimal color grading, rugged luxury mood.
