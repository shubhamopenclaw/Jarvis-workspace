# ALPHANIX Design Concept - 001
**Date:** 260226-03-00
**Theme:** "Concrete & Coordinates"
**Collection:** Core Identity / Toronto Heritage

## 1. LOUD Concept: "The Concrete Monument"
**Type:** Statement / "The Monument"
**Placement:** Full Back (Max 14"x18")
**Vibe:** Brutalist, Architectural, Power. Merging the city's icon with the gym's tool.

### Visual Description
A massive, vertical composition dominated by a high-contrast, brutalist interpretation of the CN Tower. The tower's needle extends sharply upwards. The base of the tower morphs seamlessly into the knurled handle of a heavy barbell, grounding the architecture in physical effort. Surrounding the tower is a circular text lockup: "ALPHANIX ATHLETIC CLUB" (Top arc) and "EST. MMXXVI" (Bottom arc) in a bold, condensed serif font (reminiscent of university stone engravings). The entire graphic has a slight "photocopy" or "halftone" texture to ensure it prints well as a single-color screen print.

### Gemini Prompt (Optimized for nano-banana-pro)

## 2. QUIET Concept: "The Technical Standard"
**Type:** Everyday / "The Coordinate"
**Placement:** Center Chest (Small - approx 4" wide)
**Vibe:** Minimalist, Institutional, "Quiet Luxury".

### Visual Description
A precise, typographic arrangement. The word "ALPHANIX" appears in a medium-weight Montserrat (clean sans-serif), tracked out significantly (wide letter-spacing) to create a sense of breath and luxury. Directly below it, perfectly centered, is a single line of smaller text: `TORONTO // 43.6532° N, 79.3832° W`. A thin horizontal rule (line) separates the brand name from the coordinates. The entire block is compact, centered on the chest, creating a "uniform" or "issued gear" look.
