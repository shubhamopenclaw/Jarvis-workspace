# ALPHANIX Design Concept 007 (REVISED)
**Date:** 260226-22-45
**Theme:** "The Void" (Negative Space Architecture)

## Concept 1: LOUD ("The Negative Cross")
**Vibe:** Architectural, Brutalist, High-Contrast.
**Placement:** Full Back (Centered).
**Max Dimensions:** 12" x 12".
**Ink:** White Plastisol (Solid Block).

### Design Description
**Innovation:** Instead of printing the text, we print the *space around* the text.
*   **The Shape:** A massive, solid white square block (12" x 12") printed on the center back.
*   **The Text:** The word "ALPHANIX" is **cut out** of the white block in bold, condensed sans-serif letters (Bebas Neue). The "text" is actually the black fabric of the shirt showing through the white ink.
*   **The Detail:** A thin horizontal line cuts through the entire block, splitting the word in half.
*   **Result:** A heavy, industrial "stamp" effect. It looks like a stenciled crate or a concrete casting.

**Why it works:** It uses maximum ink coverage for impact, but the branding itself is "negative space." It’s the reverse of a standard logo.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity (Male, age 30–35, thick dark brown hair styled short and clean, light stubble beard, athletic broad-shouldered build) wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The model stands confidently against a soft off-white seamless studio background. The graphic on the back is a massive solid white square block. The word "ALPHANIX" is cut out of the white block (negative space), revealing the black fabric underneath. A thin line slices through the design. Printed in thick matte white plastisol. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus, clean editorial campaign aesthetic.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a tree branch outdoors. The graphic is a large solid white square with "ALPHANIX" cut out in negative space. The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise, softly out of focus. Early morning warm natural light casts subtle highlights on the white ink texture. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic.

## Concept 2: QUIET ("The Hem Code")
**Vibe:** Technical, Data-Driven, Asymmetric.
**Placement:** Front Left Hem (Bottom Corner).
**Max Dimensions:** 4" x 2".
**Ink:** Matte Grey (Subtle) or High-Density Black.

### Design Description
**NOT** a chest logo. This is a technical "label" printed directly on the fabric.
*   **Location:** Extreme bottom left corner of the front hem.
*   **Graphic:** A strict 3-line data stack:
    1.  **ALPHANIX [DIV. 06]**
    2.  **LOT: 007 // MMXXVI**
    3.  **ENGINEERED IN TORONTO**
*   **Font:** Monospace (Courier or Roboto Mono). Tiny point size (8-10pt).
*   **Why it works:** It leaves the chest completely blank/clean, pushing the branding to a "utility label" position. It feels like issued gear.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The chest is completely blank. The only graphic is a small, technical data stack printed on the bottom left hem ("ALPHANIX [DIV. 06]"). The print is matte grey monospace text. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus on the hem detail.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a tree branch outdoors. The chest is clean. The focus is on the bottom hem, where a small technical code is printed ("LOT: 007"). The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic.
