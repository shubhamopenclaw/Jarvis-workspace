**Date:** 260226-17-30
**Theme:** "Institutional Athleticism"
**Collection:** Core Identity / Wearability First

## 1. QUIET Concept: "The Essential"
**Type:** Everyday / Wearable
**Placement:** Center Chest (Clean, spaced)
**Vibe:** Fear of God Essentials style. Pure typography. High-end, unassuming.

### Visual Description
A minimalist typographic layout. The word "ALPHANIX" is set in a medium-weight sans-serif font (Montserrat), tracked out significantly (wide letter-spacing) to create breath. Below it, in a much smaller, lighter weight, is "ATHLETIC CLUB". The text is perfectly centered. No icons, no lines, no distractions. The focus is entirely on the silhouette and the negative space.

### Technical Breakdown
- **Placement:** Center Chest (approx. 5" wide)
- **Ink:** White Plastisol (Matte finish)
- **Typography:** Montserrat Medium (Tracking: 200), Montserrat Light (Tracking: 100)

### Gemini Prompt (Studio)
> A high-resolution product shot of a black heavyweight t-shirt folded neatly on a white surface. The graphic is a minimalist center-chest print: "ALPHANIX" in wide-spaced, medium-weight white sans-serif text, with "ATHLETIC CLUB" in smaller text below it. 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting, sharp focus, clean lines, no background distractions.

### Gemini Prompt (Atmospheric)
> A cinematic shot of a black t-shirt hanging on a rusted metal locker in a cold, dim gym locker room. Toronto morning light filtering through a high window. The graphic "ALPHANIX" (wide spacing) is visible on the chest. 35mm film grain, moody, desaturated, street photography style, high contrast.

## 2. TECHNICAL Concept: "The Data Spine"
**Type:** Statement / Technical
**Placement:** Vertical Spine (Back)
**Vibe:** Industrial, precise, "Issued Gear".

### Visual Description
A vertical stack of data running down the spine of the shirt. The text is small, mono-spaced (like computer code or technical specs). It reads:
`ALPHANIX // DIV. 01`
`EST. MMXXVI`
`HEAVYWEIGHT COTTON`
`TORONTO, CA`
The text is aligned vertically, creating a "spine" effect. It looks like a technical label or a shipping manifest.

### Technical Breakdown
- **Placement:** Vertical Center Back (Running down the spine)
- **Ink:** Cool Grey Plastisol (Subtle contrast)
- **Typography:** Roboto Mono or similar technical font.

### Gemini Prompt (Studio)
> A high-resolution product shot of the BACK of a black heavyweight t-shirt. Running vertically down the spine is a line of small, technical text in cool grey ink: "ALPHANIX // DIV. 01", "EST. MMXXVI", "HEAVYWEIGHT COTTON". 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting, focus on the fabric texture and print quality.

### Gemini Prompt (Atmospheric)
> A cinematic shot from behind of a person wearing a black oversized t-shirt in a raw concrete gym. The vertical spine print (technical text data) is visible. 35mm film grain, moody lighting, "Quiet Luxury" streetwear aesthetic, gymshark style but more industrial.

## 3. LOUD Concept: "The Abstract Form"
**Type:** Statement / "The Monument"
**Placement:** Full Back (High)
**Vibe:** Abstract, Geometric, Architectural (Non-literal).

### Visual Description
A large, abstract geometric shape on the upper back. It looks like a shattered stone or a brutalist architectural plan, but it's not a specific building. It's a composition of sharp angles, negative space, and "eroded" textures. Overlaid on this shape is the text "ALPHANIX" in a bold, distorted font, as if the text is part of the structure. It conveys strength and solidity without being a picture of a gym or a landmark.

### Technical Breakdown
- **Placement:** Upper Back (Large, approx 12" wide)
- **Ink:** White Plastisol (Distressed texture)
- **Typography:** Custom Geometric Display Font + Distressed Texture

### Gemini Prompt (Studio)
> A high-resolution product shot of the BACK of a black heavyweight t-shirt. A large, abstract geometric graphic (white ink) covers the upper back. It looks like shattered stone or architectural plans. The word "ALPHANIX" is integrated into the design. 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting, sharp focus.

### Gemini Prompt (Atmospheric)
> A cinematic shot of a black t-shirt draped over a gym bench. The back graphic is visible: a large, abstract, brutalist white shape with "ALPHANIX" text. 35mm film grain, dusty atmosphere, raw industrial gym setting, high contrast lighting.
