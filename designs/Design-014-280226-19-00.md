**Date:** 280226-19-00
**Aesthetic:** Institutional Athleticism

## Concept 1: LOUD - "The Seismic Shift"
**Vibe:** Raw power, tectonic movement, undeniable presence.
**Visual:** The word "ALPHANIX" is rendered in a massive, heavy sans-serif font (Impact/Bebas style). The text is sliced horizontally through the middle, with the top half shifted slightly to the right and the bottom half to the left, creating a "fault line" effect. The edges of the slice are jagged and distressed, suggesting concrete breaking under pressure. Below the main text, smaller sub-text reads "EST. 2025 // TORONTO OPS" in a clean, spaced-out sans-serif.

### Technical Breakdown
- **Placement:** Full Upper Back (spanning shoulder to shoulder).
- **Dimensions:** 12" x 5" approx.
- **Ink:** High-Density White Puff Print (for the main text) + Flat Grey Plastisol (for sub-text).
- **Texture:** Distressed/Grunge overlay on the main text to mimic concrete texture.

### Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)
A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The model stands with his back to the camera, showcasing the "The Seismic Shift" design. The graphic features the word "ALPHANIX" in massive white block letters, split horizontally with a jagged fault line, creating a shifted effect like broken concrete. The texture is thick, high-density puff print with visible cracking details. Below it, small "EST. 2025 // TORONTO OPS" text in grey. High-end commercial fitness lighting with a strong rim light highlighting the muscular back definition and the raised texture of the print. The background is a soft off-white seamless studio wall. 85mm lens, sharp focus, clean editorial campaign aesthetic.

### Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)
A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a chain-link fence in an urban basketball court. The "The Seismic Shift" design is visible on the back of the shirt, featuring the split "ALPHANIX" text with a gritty, concrete texture in white puff print. The background shows a blurred Toronto cityscape at dusk, with streetlights starting to glow. The lighting is moody and dramatic, with shadows casting across the fence links onto the fabric. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic, rugged luxury mood, 85mm lens look.

## Concept 2: QUIET - "The Coordinates Tab"
**Vibe:** Military precision, understated technicality, "if you know, you know."
**Visual:** A small, rectangular design located at the high center back, just below the collar. It mimics a sewn-on military spec tag but is printed directly. It features a thin rectangular outline containing "ALPHANIX" in a small, clean sans-serif font on the top line, and "43.6532° N, 79.3832° W" (Toronto coordinates) on the bottom line. The lines are separated by a very thin horizontal divider.

### Technical Breakdown
- **Placement:** High Center Back (1" below collar seam).
- **Dimensions:** 2.5" x 1.5".
- **Ink:** Matte Cool Grey Plastisol (low contrast against black).
- **Texture:** Smooth, flat print. No distress.

### Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)
A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The model is facing away, close-up on the upper back and neck area. The focus is on the "The Coordinates Tab" design printed just below the collar. The design is a small, precise rectangle in matte cool grey ink, containing "ALPHANIX" and Toronto coordinates separated by a thin line. The print is subtle and clean. The lighting is soft and diffused, highlighting the texture of the heavyweight cotton fabric and the model's trap muscles. Background is a neutral grey gradient. 85mm lens, macro detail, sharp focus, premium minimalist aesthetic.

### Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)
A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour folded neatly on a polished concrete bench. The "The Coordinates Tab" design on the back neck area is visible and in focus. The print is subtle cool grey against the deep black fabric. In the blurred background, out-of-focus gym equipment and a water bottle suggest a post-workout setting. Natural daylight streams in from a nearby window, creating soft highlights on the fabric folds. Photorealistic, high-end lifestyle photography, minimal color grading, quiet luxury mood.
