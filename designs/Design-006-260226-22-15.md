# ALPHANIX Design Concept 006 (REVISED)
**Date:** 260226-22-15
**Theme:** "The Monolith" (Scale over Noise)

## Concept 1: LOUD ("The Vertices")
**Vibe:** Architectural, Sharp, Massive.
**Placement:** Full Back (Blade to Blade).
**Max Dimensions:** 14" x 10".
**Ink:** White Plastisol (Clean).

### Design Description
A pure typographic structure. No boxes, no lines, no barcodes.
The word **ALPHANIX** is split into two stacked lines of massive, heavy sans-serif text (Montserrat ExtraBold or Impact).
**Line 1:** ALPHA
**Line 2:** NIX
The two lines are justified to be the exact same width. The spacing between them is tight (negative space). The letters are sharp and solid. It looks like a heavy concrete block.
**Micro-Detail:** A tiny, single "®" or "TM" mark at the bottom right corner of the X. That’s it.

**Why it works:** It screams the name from across the gym, but it’s disciplined. It’s a "brand billboard" on the back.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A high-resolution product shot of the back of a black heavyweight t-shirt. The graphic is a massive, two-line text block: "ALPHA" on top, "NIX" on bottom. The font is heavy, bold, and white. The two lines are perfectly aligned in width. 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting, sharp focus.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic shot from behind of a bodybuilder doing a cable row. The back of the black t-shirt features a huge, heavy white text block "ALPHA / NIX". The design looks like a solid concrete structure. 35mm film grain, high contrast, powerful.

## Concept 2: QUIET ("The Shoulder Seam Integration")
*(Kept from previous batch as it fit the brief perfectly)*
**Vibe:** Anatomical, Engineered, Subtle.
**Placement:** Left Shoulder Seam (Following the stitching line).
**Max Dimensions:** 6" x 0.5".
**Ink:** High-Density (Puff) Tonal Black or Matte Grey.

### Design Description
**NOT** a floating logo. This text rides the actual *seam* of the garment.
*   **Location:** The design runs *along* the shoulder seam (from neck to shoulder cap) on the left side.
*   **Graphic:** A single line of text: "ALPHANIX [EST. MMXXVI]".
*   **Execution:** The text is slightly raised (High Density) but matches the shirt color (Tonal) or is a dark matte grey. It emphasizes the *width* of the shoulders by drawing a line across the trap muscle.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A high-resolution close-up of the left shoulder of a black heavyweight t-shirt. A line of raised, tonal text ("ALPHANIX [EST. MMXXVI]") runs exactly along the shoulder seam from the collar to the sleeve. The print is high-density puff, creating a 3D texture on the fabric. 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting showing the texture.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A lifestyle close-up of a bodybuilder's trap muscle and shoulder. They are wearing a black t-shirt. The shoulder seam features a subtle, raised text graphic running along it. The lighting catches the 3D relief of the letters. It looks engineered and custom-fitted. 35mm film grain, moody gym lighting.
