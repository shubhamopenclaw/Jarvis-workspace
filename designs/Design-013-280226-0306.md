## 013-A: [LOUD] The "Sector 6ix" Technical Grid
**Placement:** Full Back
**Max Dimensions:** 14" x 16"
**Ink:** White Plastisol on Black T-Shirt

### Technical Breakdown
A high-impact, technical graphic inspired by command-center wireframes. The design features a stylized vector grid of Toronto's downtown core ("Sector 6ix"). Overlaid on the grid is the word "ALPHANIX" in a large, condensed, slightly eroded font. Technical callouts like "STRENGH THROUGH DISCIPLINE" and "REDACTED" are placed in small Montserrat text in the corners of the grid.

### Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot
A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour, viewed from the back. The model stands confidently against a soft off-white seamless studio background with subtle gradient shadow. High-end commercial fitness lighting with soft overhead key light and controlled rim light outlining the shoulders and traps. The graphic—a technical white vector grid map of Toronto with large bold 'ALPHANIX' text overlaid—is printed in thick white colour using matte screen-print ink. Allow only natural fabric folds. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus, clean editorial campaign aesthetic, rugged luxury fitness brand.

### Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot
A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a tree branch outdoors. The back features a technical white vector grid map of Toronto with large bold 'ALPHANIX' text overlaid, printed with a matte white plastisol screen-printing ink. The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise, softly out of focus with shallow depth of field (85mm lens look). Early morning warm natural light casts subtle highlights and realistic shadows on the fabric. Slight breeze movement creates natural cotton drape. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic, minimal color grading, rugged luxury mood.
