# ALPHANIX Design Concept 003
**Date:** 260226-19-00
**Theme:** Institutional Athleticism (Vertical & High-Neck Focus)

## Concept 1: LOUD ("The Eroded Pillar")
**Vibe:** Industrial, Brutalist, Raw.
**Placement:** Vertical Spine (Back).
**Max Dimensions:** 4" x 16".
**Ink:** White Plastisol (High Opacity, Distressed Texture).

### Design Description
A bold, vertical typographic stack running down the spine of the shirt. The word "ALPHANIX" is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise to read top-to-bottom. The font is a heavy, block sans-serif (customized Impact or bold Montserrat). The text features a heavy "concrete erosion" texture—parts of the letters are missing or faded as if weathered by city elements. No containers, no borders. Just the raw, imposing text column.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A high-resolution product shot of the back of a black heavyweight t-shirt folded to show the spine. The graphic is a large, vertically stacked "ALPHANIX" text running down the center back. The text is printed in thick white plastisol ink with a distressed, eroded texture. 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting, sharp focus on the texture of the print.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic shot from behind of a person wearing a black t-shirt, standing in a dimly lit, concrete underground parking garage. The vertical "ALPHANIX" text on the spine is illuminated by a harsh overhead fluorescent light. The print looks gritty and industrial. 35mm film grain, moody, high contrast, streetwear photography style.

## Concept 2: QUIET ("The Mock-Neck Minimalist")
**Vibe:** Premium, Essential, Disciplined.
**Placement:** High Neck / Collarbone (Center Front).
**Max Dimensions:** 3" x 0.5".
**Ink:** White Plastisol (Soft Hand, Clean).

### Design Description
A strictly minimal placement sitting high on the neckline, mimicking a mock-neck branding style. The text "ALPHANIX" is set in a medium-weight Montserrat, all caps, with wide tracking (letter-spacing). Below it, centered, is a tiny "DIV. 01" in a smaller point size. No lines, no boxes. The focus is purely on the precision of the placement and the clean negative space around the collar.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A high-resolution close-up product shot of the neck area of a black heavyweight t-shirt. The graphic is a small, crisp "ALPHANIX" text with "DIV. 01" underneath, printed in white plastisol right at the base of the collar. The fabric texture is visible. 8k, photorealistic, bright studio lighting, sharp focus.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A lifestyle close-up of a person's neck and upper chest, wearing a black t-shirt. The setting is a minimalist gym with soft, natural light coming from a window. The small "ALPHANIX" text at the high neck is subtle but legible. Shallow depth of field, focusing on the collar detail. 35mm film grain, clean, "quiet luxury" aesthetic.
