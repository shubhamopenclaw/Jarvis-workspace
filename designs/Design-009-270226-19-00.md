**Date:** 27-02-2026
**Time:** 19:00 UTC
**Status:** Concept Phase

## Concept 1: LOUD - "The Shattered Monolith"
**Theme:** Breaking Limits / Explosive Energy.
**Visuals:** A massive, heavy-weight "ALPHANIX" logotype across the upper back. The letters are not solid; they are fractured, resembling concrete or stone that is exploding outward from the center. The debris floats slightly away from the main letterforms.
**Placement:** Upper Back (Shoulder to Shoulder).
**Ink:** White Puff Print (for texture on the "stone" fragments).

### Technical Breakdown
- **Placement:** Upper Back across shoulders.
- **Max Dimensions:** 12" x 5".
- **Ink:** High-density White Puff Plastisol (3D effect).

### Prompt 1: Studio Shot (Verification)
A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The model stands confidently against a soft off-white seamless studio background with subtle gradient shadow. High-end commercial fitness lighting with soft overhead key light and controlled rim light outlining the shoulders and traps. The graphic is a massive, heavy-weight 'ALPHANIX' logotype across the upper back where the letters appear to be fracturing like exploding concrete with debris floating outward, printed in thick white puff ink. Allow only natural fabric folds. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus, clean editorial campaign aesthetic, rugged luxury fitness brand.

### Prompt 2: Atmospheric Shot (Vibe)
A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a tree branch outdoors. The graphic is a massive, heavy-weight 'ALPHANIX' logotype across the upper back where the letters appear to be fracturing like exploding concrete with debris floating outward, printed with a matte white plastisol screen-printing ink. The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise, softly out of focus with shallow depth of field (85mm lens look). Early morning warm natural light casts subtle highlights and realistic shadows on the fabric. Slight breeze movement creates natural cotton drape. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic, minimal color grading, rugged luxury mood.
