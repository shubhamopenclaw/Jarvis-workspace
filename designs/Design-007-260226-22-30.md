# ALPHANIX Design Concept 007
**Date:** 260226-22-30
**Theme:** "Structural Minimalism" (Editorial & Clean)

## Concept 1: LOUD ("The Vertices")
**Vibe:** Architectural, Sharp, Massive.
**Placement:** Full Back (Blade to Blade).
**Max Dimensions:** 14" x 10".
**Ink:** White Plastisol (Clean).

### Design Description
A pure typographic structure. No boxes, no lines, no barcodes.
The word **ALPHANIX** is split into two stacked lines of massive, heavy sans-serif text (Montserrat ExtraBold or Impact).
**Line 1:** ALPHA
**Line 2:** NIX
The two lines are justified to be the exact same width. The spacing between them is tight (negative space). The letters are sharp and solid. It looks like a heavy concrete block.
**Micro-Detail:** A tiny, single "®" or "TM" mark at the bottom right corner of the X. That’s it.

**Why it works:** It screams the name from across the gym, but it’s disciplined. It’s a "brand billboard" on the back.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A hyper-realistic professional studio photograph of the ALPHANIX Primary Model Identity (Male, age 30–35, thick dark brown hair styled short and clean, light stubble beard, symmetrical masculine facial structure, strong square jawline, straight nose, defined cheekbones, deep-set brown eyes, athletic broad-shouldered build, muscular chest and arms, defined but not exaggerated physique, 10–12% body fat, tall proportions, calm confident expression, no tattoos, no jewelry) wearing a premium heavyweight oversized cotton t-shirt in Black colour. The model stands confidently against a soft off-white seamless studio background with subtle gradient shadow. High-end commercial fitness lighting with soft overhead key light and controlled rim light outlining the shoulders and traps. The graphic is a massive, two-line text block: "ALPHA" on top, "NIX" on bottom. The font is heavy, bold, and white. The two lines are perfectly aligned in width. It is printed in thick white colour using matte screen-print ink. Allow only natural fabric folds. Shot on an 85mm lens, photorealistic, sharp focus, clean editorial campaign aesthetic, rugged luxury fitness brand.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic editorial photograph of a premium heavyweight oversized t-shirt in Black colour hanging naturally from a matte black wooden hanger on a tree branch outdoors. The graphic is a massive, two-line text block: "ALPHA" on top, "NIX" on bottom. The font is heavy, bold, and white. It is printed with a matte white plastisol screen-printing ink. The Toronto skyline is visible in the background at sunrise, softly out of focus with shallow depth of field (85mm lens look). Early morning warm natural light casts subtle highlights and realistic shadows on the fabric. Slight breeze movement creates natural cotton drape. Photorealistic, high-end fashion campaign aesthetic, minimal color grading, rugged luxury mood.

## Concept 2: QUIET ("The Shoulder Seam Integration")
**Vibe:** Anatomical, Engineered, Subtle.
**Placement:** Left Shoulder Seam (Following the stitching line).
**Max Dimensions:** 6" x 0.5".
**Ink:** High-Density (Puff) Tonal Black or Matte Grey.

### Design Description
**NOT** a floating logo. This text rides the actual *seam* of the garment.
*   **Location:** The design runs *along* the shoulder seam (from neck to shoulder cap) on the left side.
*   **Graphic:** A single line of text: "ALPHANIX [EST. MMXXVI]".
*   **Execution:** The text is slightly raised (High Density) but matches the shirt color (Tonal) or is a dark matte grey. It emphasizes the *width* of the shoulders by drawing a line across the trap muscle.
