# ALPHANIX Design Concept 006
**Date:** 260226-22-05
**Theme:** "The Architect's Blueprint" (Structural & Integrated)

## Concept 1: LOUD ("The Blueprint Stack")
**Vibe:** Technical, Institutional, Informational.
**Placement:** Full Back (Center).
**Max Dimensions:** 12" x 16".
**Ink:** White Plastisol (Crisp) or Matte Grey on Black.

### Design Description
A structured, heavy typographic design that looks like the cover of a classified technical manual.
*   **Top:** "ALPHANIX" in wide-tracked Montserrat Bold.
*   **Middle:** A large, thin rectangular wireframe box. Inside the box is a breakdown of the brand's core values listed like specs: "DISCIPLINE // PRECISION // LEGACY".
*   **Bottom:** A heavy barcode graphic and "TORONTO OPS: DIV-06" in a monospace font.
*   **Key Detail:** The entire graphic is crossed by a single diagonal "stamp" line that says "AUTHORIZED" or "ISSUED" in a hollow outline font.

**Innovation:** Turns the wearer into a "walking dossier." It's text-heavy but organized strictly on a grid.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A high-resolution product shot of the back of a black heavyweight t-shirt. The graphic is a large, technical "blueprint" layout in white plastisol. It features "ALPHANIX" at the top, a wireframe box with "DISCIPLINE // PRECISION" text inside, and a barcode at the bottom. A diagonal hollow "stamp" graphic overlays the text. 8k, photorealistic, clean studio lighting.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A cinematic shot from behind of a person in a concrete stairwell. The lighting is cold and clinical. The back of their black t-shirt features a crisp, white technical graphic that looks like a government dossier or blueprint. The text is sharp and legible. 35mm film grain, desaturated, "Tenet" movie aesthetic.

## Concept 2: QUIET ("The Shoulder Seam Integration")
**Vibe:** Anatomical, Engineered, Subtle.
**Placement:** Left Shoulder Seam (Following the stitching line).
**Max Dimensions:** 6" x 0.5".
**Ink:** High-Density (Puff) Tonal Black or Matte Grey.

### Design Description
**NOT** a floating logo. This text rides the actual *seam* of the garment.
*   **Location:** The design runs *along* the shoulder seam (from neck to shoulder cap) on the left side.
*   **Graphic:** A single line of text: "ALPHANIX [EST. MMXXVI]".
*   **Execution:** The text is slightly raised (High Density) but matches the shirt color (Tonal) or is a dark matte grey. It emphasizes the *width* of the shoulders by drawing a line across the trap muscle.
*   **Why it works:** It highlights the physique (traps/shoulders) using the garment's own construction lines.

### Gemini Prompts
**Prompt 1: The "Studio" Shot (Verification)**
> A high-resolution close-up of the left shoulder of a black heavyweight t-shirt. A line of raised, tonal text ("ALPHANIX [EST. MMXXVI]") runs exactly along the shoulder seam from the collar to the sleeve. The print is high-density puff, creating a 3D texture on the fabric. 8k, photorealistic, studio lighting showing the texture.

**Prompt 2: The "Atmospheric" Shot (Vibe)**
> A lifestyle close-up of a bodybuilder's trap muscle and shoulder. They are wearing a black t-shirt. The shoulder seam features a subtle, raised text graphic running along it. The lighting catches the 3D relief of the letters. It looks engineered and custom-fitted. 35mm film grain, moody gym lighting.
